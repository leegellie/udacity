				<h2>Inline &amp; Block Elements</h2>
			  <p><span class="content">Some elements can be &quot;inline&quot; which meants they would go along in a sentance as if it was a word. Others can be &quot;block&quot; which means that the computer sees it as having its own space and breaks out of the line to put a box around it.</span></p>

        	<article id="note5" class="note">
				<h2>HTML Code Structure</h2>
			  <p><span class="content">HTML code must be structured for ease of use and accuracy in editing. Without your code structured it is very hard to make your web page look like anything but a basic word document. With structure from the apropriate elements such as DIV tags and such you can then manipulate these with CSS to look and act like anything you want. </span></p>
            </article>
        	<article id="note6" class="note">
				<h2>Avoid Repetition</h2>
			  <p><span class="content">Repeating styling codes not just wastes space and creates bigger, bulkier files but it also makes it harder to change document-wide styles and structure. Starting at top level selectors like classes and pseudo </span>tags can make it easy to quickly change the whole appearance of a web page. For more precise and individual formatting selectors such as IDs and attributes can be used which, as the are more specific selectors, will only edit the styles for the specific tags even if a higher selector is modifying them.</p>

Selectors can be tags, classes, ids, attributes, seudo tags and pseudo elements. You then assign properties (style) to those selectors and anything that has the selector will be styalized as defined.</span></p>
